## Goal

Understand how events trigger scripts and how timing controls pacing.

## Try it

Build a short sequence that starts on the flag and then on a key press.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
say [Ready] for (1) seconds
wait (0.5) seconds
say [Go!] for (1) seconds
```

## Checkpoint

You can trigger the same sprite with multiple events without confusion.
