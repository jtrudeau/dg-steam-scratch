## Goal

Control where a sprite is and where it goes.

## Try it

Create a sprite that moves in a square and returns to center.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
repeat (4)
  move (80) steps
  turn right (90) degrees
end
```

## Checkpoint

You can send a sprite to exact positions without it drifting.
