## Goal

Use clones to build dynamic scenes with less manual work.

## Try it

Create a clone every second and move it across the screen.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
forever
  create clone of [myself v]
  wait (1) seconds
end
when I start as a clone
  go to x: (-220) y: (0)
  glide (2) secs to x: (220) y: (0)
  delete this clone
```

## Checkpoint

Clones appear and disappear without slowing the project.
