## Goal

Create control schemes that match your game or story.

## Try it

Build left/right movement with a loop that checks keys.

```scratch
forever
  if <key [left arrow v] pressed?> then
    change x by (-5)
  end
  if <key [right arrow v] pressed?> then
    change x by (5)
  end
end
```

## Checkpoint

You can explain the difference between tap and hold controls.
