## Goal

Use lists for collections that grow over time.

## Try it

Create a list of questions and display a random one.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
add [Question A] to [questions v]
add [Question B] to [questions v]
say (item (pick random (1) to (length of [questions v])) of [questions v])
```

## Checkpoint

You can store at least 3 items and pick one reliably.
