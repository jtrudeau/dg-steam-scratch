## Goal

Keep sprites and scenes in sync using messages.

## Try it

Broadcast a message to change a backdrop and start a new sprite action.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
broadcast [scene-2 v]
when I receive [scene-2 v]
switch backdrop to [ocean v]
```

## Checkpoint

You can coordinate two sprites without timing hacks.
