## Goal

Create visual changes that help the audience follow the action.

## Try it

Switch costumes and backdrops after a short wait.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
switch backdrop to [city v]
wait (1) seconds
switch backdrop to [space v]
```

## Checkpoint

You can change scenes without breaking the rest of the scripts.
