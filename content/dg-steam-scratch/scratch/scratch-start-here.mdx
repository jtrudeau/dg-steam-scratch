## Goal

Set expectations for the Scratch learning path and how to practice with it.

## Try it

Make a tiny script so you can test that blocks render and run in Scratch.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
say [I am ready to build!] for (2) seconds
```

## Checkpoint

You can run a script, make a change, and re-test without help.
