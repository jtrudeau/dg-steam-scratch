1. **Stage (right side)** – where your story/game runs. Try clicking the green flag and red stop buttons.
2. **Sprites list (bottom right)** – every character or object in your scene. Click a sprite to edit its code & costumes.
3. **Blocks palette (left)** – color-coded categories (Motion, Looks, Sound, Events, Control, Sensing, Operators, Variables, My Blocks).
4. **Scripts area (center)** – drag blocks here to build logic. Stack blocks vertically; wrap logic in loops or conditionals.
5. **Tabs (Code / Costumes / Sounds)** – use Costumes to edit art, Sounds to add effects/music.

> Quick shortcut: right-click a stack of blocks → “duplicate” to speed up iteration.  
> Debug tip: use “say” bubbles to log what your sprite is thinking (e.g., `say (join "score" score)`).
