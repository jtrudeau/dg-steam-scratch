## Scratch Interface Tour

Learn the key parts of the Scratch editor.

### The Main Areas

1. **Stage (right side)** – where your story/game runs. Try clicking the green flag and red stop buttons.

2. **Sprites list (bottom right)** – every character or object in your scene. Click a sprite to edit its code & costumes.

3. **Blocks palette (left)** – color-coded categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Events, Control, Sensing, Operators, Variables, My Blocks

4. **Scripts area (center)** – drag blocks here to build logic. Stack blocks vertically; wrap logic in loops or conditionals.

5. **Tabs (Code / Costumes / Sounds)** – use Costumes to edit art, Sounds to add effects/music.

### Quick Shortcuts

> Right-click a stack of blocks → "duplicate" to speed up iteration.

### Debug Tip

Use "say" bubbles to log what your sprite is thinking:

```scratch
say (join [score: ] (score))
```

This helps you see variable values while your program runs!
