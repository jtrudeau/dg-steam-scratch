## Flow

1. **Warmup circle (5 min)** – Students share one SDG fact they found between sessions.
2. **Mini brief (10 min)** – Introduce the challenge template: “Show + tell an SDG data point in 30 seconds.”
3. **Build sprint (25 min)** – Pairs remix a starter project, adding looks/sound blocks and control (repeat, wait).
4. **Gallery walk (10 min)** – Quiet showcase; peers leave “spark” sticky notes with appreciations and questions.

## Teacher Moves

- Encourage purposeful use of sound—celebrate teams who pair audio with on-screen data.
- Model how to duplicate sprites + change costumes quickly.
- Debrief by connecting mini challenges to the upcoming project ideation workshop.
