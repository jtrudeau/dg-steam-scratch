## Exploring Events and Motion

Today we'll learn how events make sprites respond to user actions.

### Event-Driven Programming

Events are triggers that start scripts. Here's a basic event:

```scratch
when this sprite clicked
say [You clicked me!] for (2) secs
```

### Keyboard Controls

Make your sprite move with arrow keys:

```scratch
when [space v] key pressed
change y by (10)

when [left arrow v] key pressed
change x by (-10)

when [right arrow v] key pressed
change x by (10)
```

### Challenge: Interactive Story

Create a sprite that:
1. Says something when clicked
2. Changes costume when space pressed  
3. Moves with arrow keys

```scratch
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
say [Click me to start!]

when this sprite clicked
say [Now press space!] for (2) secs

when [space v] key pressed
next costume
say [Press arrow keys to move!]
```

### Debug Tips

If your sprite doesn't respond:
- Check that the event block is at the **top** of the stack
- Make sure you're clicking/pressing the right thing
- Use `say` blocks to test if events are firing
