## Flow

1. **Story spark (5 min)** – Share a quick SDG story and ask: “What could we build in Scratch to explain this?”
2. **Studio tour (15 min)** – Walk through stage, sprites, blocks, and backpack. Students complete a scavenger hunt.
3. **Mini challenge (20 min)** – Build a “Hello, DG!” animation that changes backdrops and uses at least one event + one motion block.
4. **Team charter (15 min)** – Assign rotating roles, draft communication norms, and list personal Scratch goals.

## Teacher Moves

- Circulate with a debugging protocol: ask “What do you expect this block to do?” before giving hints.
- Capture any access issues (logins, hardware) for remediation before Session 2.
- Collect a photo of each team + starter project link for documentation.
