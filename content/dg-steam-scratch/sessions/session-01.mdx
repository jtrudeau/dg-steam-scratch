## Getting Started with Scratch

Welcome to your first Scratch session! Today you'll create your first interactive animation.

### Your First Script

Here's a simple script to get you started:

```scratch
when green flag clicked
say [Hello, DG!] for (2) secs
move (10) steps
```

### Challenge: Make a Sprite Dance

Try combining these blocks:

```scratch
when green flag clicked
repeat (4)
  move (10) steps
  turn right (90) degrees
end
```
