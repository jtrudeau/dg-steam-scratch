## Your Team Home Base

Today you set up everything your team needs to work together for the rest of the project.

By the end of today, your team will have:

- **A Google Doc** with your team name, members, sustainable business idea, and Scratch project ideas
- **A shared Scratch project link** in your Google Doc so everyone can find your team's work

### Step 1: Finalize Your Worksheet

Look at what you wrote last session. Make sure you have:

- Your team name
- Names of every team member
- Your sustainable business idea (1-2 sentences about the problem you're solving)
- At least two ideas for how this could become a Scratch project

### Step 2: Create Your Team Google Doc

One person on your team creates a new Google Doc.

**In the doc, write:**

1. **Team Name**
2. **Team Members** (everyone's name)
3. **Our Sustainable Business Idea** — What problem are you solving? How does it help people, the planet, or both?
4. **Our Scratch Project Ideas** — your brainstorm from the worksheet

Share the doc with every team member so everyone can edit it.

### Step 3: Share Your Scratch Project

Your team needs one Scratch project that everyone can find. If someone on your team already started a project, use that one. Otherwise, create a new one.

**How to share a Scratch project:**

1. Open your project in the Scratch editor
2. Click the orange **Share** button at the top of the page
3. Give your project a clear title (use your team name)
4. The link in your browser bar is your project link — it looks like `scratch.mit.edu/projects/123456789`
5. **Copy that link and paste it into your team's Google Doc**

**Good to know:**
- Once a project is shared, anyone with the link can see it and remix it
- Only the project owner can edit the original — teammates can open it to see the code and remix their own copy
- Your team will build on this project together over the coming weeks

### Step 4: Check In

When your Google Doc has everything — team info, business idea, Scratch ideas, and the project link — **call Mr. Joel over to your team**. He'll check that you're all set.

### Step 5: Explore and Build

Once you're checked in, start building! Try making a small piece of your project idea in Scratch:

- A character or sprite
- A background or scene
- One interaction (click, keypress, movement)
