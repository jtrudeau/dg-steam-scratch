## Discover Your Project

Today your team connects your sustainable business idea to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and starts imagining what your Scratch project could be.

### Step 1: SDG Deep Dive

Open the [SDG Explorer](/sdgs) and look through the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.

**As a team, answer:**

- Which SDGs connect to your sustainable business idea?
- Pick your **top 2-3 goals** that fit best
- Be ready to explain why you chose them

### Step 2: Engineering Connection

Now look at your business idea through an **engineering** lens.

**Talk through these questions together:**

- Is there a physical product, machine, or system in your idea?
- What technical problem does it solve?
- How does it actually work?

Write down your answers — this is the foundation for your Scratch project.

### Step 3: Brainstorm Your Scratch Project

How could Scratch bring your idea to life? Think big first, then narrow down.

**Your project could be:**

- A **simulation** of your machine or system
- An **interactive model** of your product
- A **story** showing a user's journey with your idea
- A **game** that teaches people about the problem you're solving

Brainstorm at least two different directions. Focus on what the project **does**, not how to code it yet.

### Step 4: Feasibility Check

Reality check time. Look at your brainstorm and ask:

- Can we build a working version of this in Scratch?
- What's the **simplest version** that still shows our idea?
- What could we add later as a stretch goal?

If your idea feels too big, simplify it. A small project that works is better than a big one that doesn't.
