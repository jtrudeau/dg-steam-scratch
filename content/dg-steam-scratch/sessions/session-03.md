  - title: "Bug hunt lab"
    duration: "20 min"
    description: "Pairs debug a provided project with 3 planted issues (event order, broadcast missing, sensing typo)."
  - title: "Broadcast patterns mini-lesson"
    duration: "10 min"
    description: "Show how to broadcast scene changes and coordinate sprites; students sketch a messaging map."

teacherMoves:
  - "Use the debugging protocol aloud: observe → predict → test → adjust. Have students narrate their predictions."
  - "If a team stalls, point them to the micro-tutorial steps before giving a direct fix."
  - "Capture misconceptions around broadcast vs. events to revisit in Session 5 storyboarding."
