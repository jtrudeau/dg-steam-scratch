studentObjective: "Create a concrete plan for your Scratch project on paper — clear enough that someone outside your team could understand what you're building."
teacherGoal: "Get every team to translate their business idea into a buildable Scratch project plan. Collect blueprint sheets for written feedback before build sprints begin."

teacherMoves:
  - "Walk through the blueprint sections briefly as a class (2 min) before teams start working independently."
  - "Circulate during planning. Push for specificity on user interactions — 'what does the user actually DO?' is the key question."
  - "If a team is stuck on how their business idea becomes a Scratch project, ask: 'If someone opened your project right now, what would they see on the screen first?'"
  - "During presentations, note which teams have a clear buildable idea vs. which need more thinking. Write targeted feedback on each sheet before returning them."
  - "Enforce the presentation format and time — keep it moving. One question or suggestion per team from the class, not a discussion."
  - "After collecting sheets, use them to update team data (business ideas, SDGs) in the hub."

## Project Blueprint

Today: no screens. Paper and thinking only.

You've picked your team, chosen a sustainable business idea, set up your Google Doc, and started exploring in Scratch. Now it's time to make a plan — a real one, on paper, before you start building.

**By the end of today:**

- Your team will have a **project blueprint** — a one-page plan for your Scratch project
- **One person from your team** will present your plan to the class
- You'll get **real feedback** from your classmates
- Mr. Joel will collect your blueprints and give you written feedback before you start coding

### Step 1: The Blueprint Sheet

Your team gets one planning sheet. Fill out every section together. Talk it through. Argue about it. That's the point.

---

**1. The Pitch** *(1–2 sentences)*

What are you building? Say it so someone who knows nothing about your project understands.

> Example: "We're building a game where you run a sustainable clothing company and make decisions about materials, workers, and waste."

---

**2. The Problem** *(2–3 sentences)*

- What SDG does this connect to?
- What problem are you addressing?
- Who is this for?

---

**3. What the User Does** *(list 3–5 things)*

This is the most important section. When someone opens your project, what do they actually **do**?

Not "they learn about the environment." What do they **do**?

- Click something?
- Answer a question?
- Move a character?
- Make a choice?
- Collect items?
- Avoid obstacles?

**List 3 to 5 specific actions the user takes.**

> Example:
> - Click a material to see its environmental impact
> - Choose between cheap and sustainable options
> - Watch your score change based on your decisions
> - Try to keep your business alive for 10 rounds

---

**4. Scenes** *(draw 3–5 boxes)*

Draw each screen or scene your project needs. Rough is fine — stick figures, labels, boxes. Don't worry about making it pretty.

For each scene, label:
- What's on the screen
- What the user sees

---

**5. The Flow** *(arrows between your scenes)*

How does the user move from one scene to the next?

Draw arrows between your scene boxes. On each arrow, write what triggers the change:
- A button click?
- A score reaching a number?
- A choice the user makes?
- A timer running out?

---

**6. What You'll Need** *(your Scratch shopping list)*

What Scratch concepts will your project need? You don't need to know how to use them all yet — just flag what you think you'll need.

Check the ones that apply:

- [ ] Variables (score, timer, health, money...)
- [ ] Lists (questions, inventory, choices...)
- [ ] Broadcasts (scene changes, triggers between sprites...)
- [ ] Sensing (mouse clicks, key presses, touching...)
- [ ] Clones (multiple copies of a sprite...)
- [ ] Costumes/backdrops (different looks, scene changes...)
- [ ] Sound

---

**7. First Build** *(one thing)*

When you open Scratch next time, what is the **one thing** you build first?

Not the whole project. One thing.

---

### Step 2: Present Your Plan

One person from your team stands up and presents. You have about **1–2 minutes**.

**Say this:**

> "Our project is **\_\_\_**. When you open it, you **\_\_\_**."

**Then:** hold up your scene sketches and walk through the flow.

**End with:** "The first thing we're building is **\_\_\_**."

After your presentation, the class gives you **one question or one suggestion**. Listen. Write it down.

---

### Step 3: Revise

You heard feedback. Now look at your blueprint.

**Circle one thing** to change, add, or make clearer.

Hand your sheet to Mr. Joel. You'll get it back with feedback before you start building.
