  - "Circulate during planning. Push for specificity on user interactions — 'what does the user actually DO?' is the key question."
  - "If a team is stuck on how their business idea becomes a Scratch project, ask: 'If someone opened your project right now, what would they see on the screen first?'"
  - "During presentations, note which teams have a clear buildable idea vs. which need more thinking. Write targeted feedback on each sheet before returning them."
  - "Enforce the presentation format and time — keep it moving. One question or suggestion per team from the class, not a discussion."
  - "After collecting sheets, use them to update team data (business ideas, SDGs) in the hub."

## Project Blueprint

Today: no Scratch building. Paper and thinking only.

You've picked your team, chosen a sustainable business idea, set up your Google Doc, and started exploring in Scratch. Now it's time to make a plan — a real one, on paper, before you start building.

**By the end of today:**

- Your team will have a **project blueprint** — a one-page plan for your Scratch project
- **One person from your team** will present your plan to the class
- Mr. Joel will collect your blueprints and give you written feedback before you start coding

---

### Step 1: The Blueprint Sheet

Your team gets one planning sheet. Fill out every section together. Talk it through. Argue about it. That's the point.

---

**1. The Pitch** *(1–2 sentences)*

What are you building? Say it so someone who knows nothing about your project understands.

> Example: "We're building a game where you run a sustainable clothing company and make decisions about materials, workers, and waste."

---

**2. The Problem** *(2–3 sentences)*

- What [SDG](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) does this connect to?
- What problem are you addressing?
- Who is this for?

---

**3. What the User Does** *(list 3–5 things)*

This is the most important section. When someone opens your project, what do they actually **do**?

Not "they learn about the environment." What do they **do**?

- Click something?
- Answer a question?
- Move a character?
- Make a choice?
- Collect items?
- Avoid obstacles?

**List 3 to 5 specific actions the user takes.**

> Example:
> - Click a material to see its environmental impact
> - Choose between cheap and sustainable options
> - Watch your score change based on your decisions
> - Try to keep your business alive for 10 rounds

---

**4. Scenes** *(draw 3–5 boxes)*

Draw each screen or scene you think your project needs. Rough is fine — stick figures, labels, boxes. Don't worry about making it pretty.

For each scene, label:
- What's on the screen
- What the user sees

---

**5. The Flow** *(arrows between your scenes)*

How does the user move from one scene to the next?

Draw arrows between your scene boxes. On each arrow, write what triggers the change:
- A button click?
- A score reaching a number?
- A choice the user makes?
- A timer running out?

---

**6. What You'll Need** *(your Scratch shopping list)*

What Scratch concepts will your project need? You don't need to know how to use them all yet — just flag what you think you'll need.

Check the ones that apply:

- [ ] Variables (score, timer, health, money...)
- [ ] Lists (questions, inventory, choices...)
- [ ] Broadcasts (scene changes, triggers between sprites...)
- [ ] Sensing (mouse clicks, key presses, touching...)
- [ ] Clones (multiple copies of a sprite...)
- [ ] Costumes/backdrops (different looks, scene changes...)
- [ ] Sound

---

**7. First Build** *(one thing)*

When you open Scratch next time, what is the **one thing** you build first?

Not the whole project. One thing.

---

### Step 2: Present Your Plan

One person from your team stands up and presents. You have about **1–2 minutes**.

**Say this:**

> "Our project is **\_\_\_**. When you open it, you **\_\_\_**."

**Then:** hold up your scene sketches and walk through the flow.

**End with:** "The first thing we're building is **\_\_\_**."

---

### Step 3: Transfer to Your Google Doc

You've got a plan on paper. Now get the key ideas into your team's Google Doc so everyone can access them later.

Open your team's Google Doc and add:
- Your **pitch** (1–2 sentences)
- Your **user interactions** list
- Your **first build** step

You don't need to copy everything — just enough that your team knows the plan when you open Scratch next time.

When you're done, hand your blueprint sheet to Mr. Joel. You'll get it back with written feedback before you start building.
